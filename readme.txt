Overview 

This example describes a hyper-plane in support vector machine for classification. 
This code was created with reference to the official documentation 
entitled "Support Vector Machines for Binary Classification" as shown below. 
(https://jp.mathworks.com/help/stats/support-vector-machines-for-binary-classification.html?lang=en)
While the officilal document denotes how to show the decision boundary in a 2D space, 
this example represents how to describe the hype-plane in a 3D space.
